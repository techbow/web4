		        				After two hours struggling with a margin I started thinking if the idea of quitting my job was really a good decision. I told my boss that after several years I wasn't advancing in my career and that from now on I was going to be the owner of my fate. I was going to take a nanodegree! "A nano what?" She managed to say. I didn't bother to answer. I did all the paperwork and left my job. Now I'm stuck here with a magin-left...The style guide says: "Margin left? Don't use that. Forget it". But how do I align this text with the photo above? I didn't have these kinds of problems at the office. Why not continue with my previous life where I had the same problems but with the same standard solutions? I'm not built for this. I'd rather talk with my former boss and tell her I made a terrible mistake. That I had a high fever and was hallucinating... I want the security and boredom that rules in the office.

		        				I go to the kitchen. Grab this orange mug and start pouring coffee. I stare at the mug with this big "U". Ah, Udacity. I remember this girl tossing an angry bird at her co-worker who was furiously scribbling code on his computer. I remember he said something like "if you are stuck with an issue most probably someone before had the same problem, posted it on Stackoverflow and another someone answered" I go back to my computer and start googling. Twenty minutes later...nothing. I sip some coffe from my Udacity mug and then I think "What if I put the text in the same div as the photo? Bootstrap will take care of the rest..." It's just a hunch. But, wait! It works, they perfectly align! I raise my arms and flavor victory as if I were at the stadium. The public claps and cheers. Yeah, I'm becoming a ninja at coding!
